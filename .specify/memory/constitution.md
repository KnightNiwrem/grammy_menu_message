# grammy_menu_message Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Code MUST compile and type-check with TypeScript strict mode. No implicit any.
- Code MUST pass `deno fmt` and `deno lint` with zero warnings. Style is non-negotiable.
- Module imports MUST use stable sources:
	- Deno std via `jsr:@std/*`.
	- Telegram bot libraries via `https://lib.deno.dev/x/grammy@v1/*` (no sessions).
	- For this plugin, maintain dual deps files: `deps.deno.ts` and `deps.node.ts`.
- Public functions and modules MUST be small and focused:
	- Max 200 SLoC per file (excl. tests), max 50 SLoC per function where practical.
	- Cyclomatic complexity SHOULD be ≤ 10; justify and document exceptions.
- Error handling MUST be explicit: throw typed Errors or return discriminated unions; never swallow errors.
- Secrets MUST NOT be committed. Configuration MUST come from environment variables with sane defaults for local dev.

Rationale: High-quality, consistent code reduces defects, eases review, and speeds iteration.

### II. Testing Standards (Test-First)
- TDD for all new public behavior: write failing tests before implementation.
- Use `describe`/`it` from `jsr:@std/testing/bdd` and `expect` from `jsr:@std/expect`.
- Coverage targets: ≥ 85% lines overall, ≥ 90% for critical modules (menu rendering, command routing).
- Test taxonomy and structure:
	- `tests/unit/`: pure functions and utilities.
	- `tests/contract/`: bot command/menu contracts (input update → expected reply/buttons).
	- `tests/integration/`: multi-module flows and error paths.
- Bot contracts MUST assert both text and keyboard layout; prefer snapshots for stable messaging.
- CI MUST run tests on every PR across Deno and Node (deno2node build). In sandboxed CI, allow certificate flags as needed; never in production.

Rationale: Tests drive design, prevent regressions, and make behavior unambiguous.

### III. Plugin UX & API Consistency
- Command and button naming (for bots using the plugin):
	- Title Case for menu titles; verbs for actions; max 20 chars per label.
	- Back navigation MUST exist and be the last row, leftmost: "← Back".
	- Avoid emoji except to disambiguate; ≤ 1 emoji per label when used.
- Layout (for keyboards the plugin produces):
	- Max 3 columns per row, max 6 buttons per screen; overflow via pagination or submenus.
	- Consistent confirmation/cancel patterns: "Save" / "Cancel".
- Messaging (for texts the plugin templates produce):
	- Use consistent tone and punctuation. No shouting case. Provide concise error messages with recovery steps.
- Accessibility & i18n readiness: avoid hard-coded language-specific formatting; isolate user strings.

Rationale: Consistency reduces user errors and cognitive load across the bot surface.

### IV. Cross-Runtime Compatibility (Deno + Node via deno2node)
- Public API MUST be runtime-agnostic. Avoid Deno-only globals in the public surface.
- Provide dual dependency shims via `deps.deno.ts` and `deps.node.ts`.
- deno2node MUST produce a Node-compatible build targeting actively supported LTS versions.
- CI MUST build and run tests for both Deno and Node builds. Node tests run against the generated output.
- Document any runtime-specific caveats; keep them out of the default API path.

Rationale: The plugin is a library intended for both Deno and Node users; compatibility is a primary goal.

## Additional Constraints & Technology Standards
- Deno-first project: use `jsr:@std/*` for std libs. Prefer URL imports pinned by major version where applicable.
- Telegram bot: use `grammy` via `lib.deno.dev` and related plugins; DO NOT use grammy sessions.
- Library packaging: maintain dual-runtime support with `deno2node`; keep dependency boundaries in `deps.deno.ts` and `deps.node.ts`.
- No Dockerization: This is a library plugin; containerization is out of scope.

## Quality Gates & Workflow
- Pre-commit: `deno fmt`, `deno lint`, type-check, and unit tests MUST pass locally.
- Pull Requests:
	- Include explicit Constitution Check notes (how principles I–IV are satisfied).
	- CI MUST run: format/lint, type-check, tests with coverage, and Deno/Node compatibility builds.
	- Any deviation requires a justification in the plan's "Complexity Tracking" table.
- Planning docs: follow `.specify/templates/*` and keep in sync with this constitution.

## Governance
- Authority: This constitution supersedes ad-hoc practices. Conflicts resolve in favor of this document.
- Amendments: via PR including a changelog, rationale, and migration/communication plan. On merge, update version and dates.
- Versioning Policy:
	- MAJOR: breaking governance changes or principle removals/redefinitions.
	- MINOR: new principles/sections or materially expanded guidance.
	- PATCH: clarifications/wording/typos without semantic change.
- Compliance Reviews: Reviewers MUST check adherence to Principles I–IV and Quality Gates. Non-compliant PRs are rejected.
- Runtime Guidance: For environment-specific details and tooling, consult `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
