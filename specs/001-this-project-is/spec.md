# Feature Specification: Menu Message Management Plugin for grammy

**Feature Branch**: `001-this-project-is`  
**Created**: 2025-10-04  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "This project is about creating a plugin library for grammy. The plugin is used for sending and managing manages with inline keyboards. The plugin should provide menu-like utility, including but not limited to pagination and navigation history. This plugin will store menu messages that it manages, and will use it for menu-like behavior."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Capture constitution-aligned quality guardrails (UX, testing expectations, performance budgets)
8. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
9. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers
- üß≠ Call out UX, testing, and performance expectations that downstream plans must honor

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A bot developer integrates the plugin into their grammy-based bot to send menu-style messages with inline keyboards, allowing end users to navigate options fluidly while the plugin tracks and reuses each managed message.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a bot developer has defined a menu with inline keyboard options, **When** the plugin sends the menu message to a chat, **Then** the plugin stores the message reference and ensures subsequent button taps update the same message without losing state.
2. **Given** a user is viewing a paginated menu managed by the plugin, **When** they tap "Next" or "Previous", **Then** the plugin surfaces the requested page, updates the inline keyboard, and records the navigation history so the user can return to prior views.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a previously stored menu message is deleted or becomes inaccessible before an interaction occurs?  
- How does system handle simultaneous interactions on the same menu from multiple users or chats share the same menu definition?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow bot developers to define menu structures containing message templates and inline keyboard layouts that can be attached to chats.
- **FR-002**: System MUST send menu messages on behalf of the bot and retain identifiers, metadata, and contextual state needed to manage subsequent updates.
- **FR-003**: System MUST support paginated menu flows, enabling end users to move forward and backward while preserving selection state per chat.
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain a navigation history so end users can return to previously viewed menu levels without losing prior selections.
- **FR-005**: System MUST reuse stored menu messages for follow-up interactions, updating the existing message instead of creating duplicate messages where platform constraints allow.
- **FR-006**: System MUST expose controls to expire stored menu messages after configurable conditions such as inactivity or maximum history depth. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the default expiration rules and who configures them?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST isolate menu state across different chats and users to prevent cross-contamination of navigation history. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should shared menus synchronize state across users or remain entirely per-user?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a way for developers to retrieve or clear stored menu data for maintenance and compliance needs. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there retention policies or audit requirements driving data removal?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Menu Definition**: Represents the structured description of a menu (content, inline keyboard layout, pagination settings) that developers configure.
- **Menu Session**: Captures the stored state for a specific chat or user interaction with a menu, including message identifiers, active page, navigation history, and expiration markers.
- **Menu History Entry**: Records individual steps within a menu session's navigation history so the system can reconstitute prior views when requested.

## Experience & Quality Guardrails *(mandatory)*

### Menu Interaction Consistency
- Menu updates MUST feel seamless to end users: interactions should update the existing message whenever possible and avoid flicker or duplicate menu posts.
- Button labels SHOULD remain consistent within a menu family and support localization hooks for multilingual bots. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are localization assets provided by the host bot or should the plugin manage translations?]
- Navigation controls (e.g., "Next", "Back", "Home") MUST be discoverable and behave predictably across all menus.
- Accessibility considerations such as meaningful button text and predictable navigation order MUST be documented for bot developers.

### Performance Targets
- Interaction handling SHOULD complete within 500 ms for 95% of button taps under expected load, ensuring users perceive menus as responsive. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the expected peak interaction volume?]
- Stored menu lookups MUST scale to support concurrent sessions across multiple chats without noticeable degradation.
- The system SHOULD provide guidance on recommended storage limits or sharding approaches if projected traffic exceeds baseline expectations.

### Testing Signals
- Automated scenarios MUST validate that menu state persists across sequential interactions, including pagination and navigation backtracking.
- Regression coverage SHOULD verify that expired or deleted messages trigger appropriate cleanup paths without breaking active sessions.
- Integration tests MUST confirm isolation between separate chats/users and ensure no leakage of stored states.
- Load-oriented checks SHOULD monitor response time thresholds during high-frequency button interactions.
